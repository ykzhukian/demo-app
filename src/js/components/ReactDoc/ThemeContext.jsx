// Context lets us pass a value deep into the component tree

/*
It might feel redundant to pass down the user and avatarSize props through many levels if in the end only the Avatar component really needs it. It’s also annoying that whenever the Avatar component needs more props from the top, you have to add them at all the intermediate levels too.

One way to solve this issue without context is to pass down the Avatar component itself so that the intermediate components don’t need to know about the user prop
